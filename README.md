# BL-15A1_XRD
ImageJ plugin for XRD data analysis at KEK-PF BL-15A1.  
Using this plugin, Dectris PILATUS images of synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns can be loaded and analyzed.  
These codes still require cleaning-up, but were anyway put on public repository to meet the requests to inspect them. 

# How to use
Create a folder "[ImageJ root]/plugins/BL-15A1_XRD" and place BL-15A1_XRD.jar and XRDProps.config in it. Then restart ImageJ.
